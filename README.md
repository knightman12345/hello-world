# hello-world
This is a hello world repository.  Coding for fun.
Hi there I'm just coding for fun and like to learn more about coding languages.  I have dabbled with python, java, c, c++, html, javascript, ruby, web etc.  I'd like to master a language or two to see what I could build.  Let's see what we can build as a team.  I am very excited to see what we can create!
